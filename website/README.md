# TRS-GPT

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a kid, around 1984 or 1985 I got an Atari 800XL,

and it was the most joyous and addicting toy I had ever experienced.  
Thinking back, I often tell others that I greatly improved my reading and vocabulary skills while playing games such as Zork on a CRT television connected to the Atari computer.

As I played games, I became curious about how they were made, and I discovered the BASIC programming language.

Although only the basics of the language made sense to me, I got a kick out of painstakingly, manually typing in long programs that did cool things from my subscription to Antic Magazine:

But what I really wanted to write was an interactive program like Zork, but where I could chat with it, and it was able to hold an intelligent conversation with me.  In other words, it has always been my dream to have artificial general intelligence on my Atari.  

Fast forward about 40 years‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm now a middle-aged man with a multiple degrees, working for NASA JPL, and all of these years, I have kept alive the childhood dream of interacting (chatting) with the computer in an intelligent way.

This year (2023) two things happened, that allowed me to ‚Äúclose the loop‚Äù on my childhood dream:
Something called ChatGPT became a thing
Someone at work gave me a free TRS-80 Model III (built in 1981) computer.

When I was a kid, I remember friends talking about the TRS-80, referring to it as the ‚Äútrash 80‚Äù.  So my expectations weren‚Äôt that high, but hey I realized that it looked pretty retro, had about the same resolution as my old Atari 800XL, and it ran BASIC!  

When I opened the box, and fired it up (at least the thing powered on), I quickly realized that only about 10% of the keys actually worked.

So I took apart the computer, and one-by-one de-soldered every key, disassembled each one, cleaned the contacts, put the key back together, and soldered the whole keyboard back together.



After this, I had a working, beautiful TRS-80, with fully-functional keys!

Then I realized that I didn‚Äôt even have a hard drive to store BASIC programs (or anything) on.  Should I track down and buy a TRS-80 floppy drive from someone on Ebay?  No, this is 2023, and I don‚Äôt trust floppy things!  I did some searches online, and found Ian Mavric, the ‚ÄúAustralian TRS-80 Recycler‚Äù, and figured out I could get a FreHD module, which essentially allows one to plug an external board with a microSD card, into the serial ribbon cable input on the back of the TRS-80, which would emulate a hard drive.  Ian was selling the the ‚ÄúFreHD Clearly Superior Kit for M3/4‚Äù, which supposedly worked for my needs.  It was ‚Äúclearly superior‚Äù, so it had to be the right choice for me üôÇ.   Ian was really helpful, and after a few emails with him, and determining that my system actually had the needed 48K of RAM,




 I ordered the kit.  I set it up, which also involved replacing a certain ROM chip.

After this, I was off to the races, and I could play cool retro games like Microchess 1.5
